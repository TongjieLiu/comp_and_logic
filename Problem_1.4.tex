\begin{document}
\maketitle


If set $\mathbf{A}$ is enumerable and infinite, then there is a function
$f$ from the set of positive intergers onto set $\mathbf{A}$. After we've
striped all the gaps and repetitions in $f$, the new function $f'$ is a
correspondence between the set of positive integers and set $\mathbf{A}$.
