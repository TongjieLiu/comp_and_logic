\section{Part A}
\begin{proof}
	The fact that $f$ and $g$ are both total could be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		\forall a \in \mathbf{A}, \exists f(a) \\
		\forall b \in \mathbf{B}, \exists g(b)
	\end{align*}
	Since $f(a) \in \mathbf{B}, \forall a \in \mathbf{A}$, we now have:
	\begin{equation*}
		\forall a \in \mathbf{A}, \exists g(f(a)) \qedhere
	\end{equation*}
\end{proof}


\section{Part B}
\begin{proof}
	The fact that $f$ and $g$ are both onto could be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		\forall b \in \mathbf{B}, \exists a \text{ such that }
		f(a) = b \\
		\forall c \in \mathbf{C}, \exists b \text{ such that }
		g(b) = c
	\end{align*}
	This means that we now have:
	\begin{equation*}
		\forall c \in \mathbf{C}, \exists a \text{ such that }
		g(f(a)) = c \qedhere
	\end{equation*}
\end{proof}


\section{Part C}
\begin{proof}
	The fact that $f$ and $g$ are both one-to-one could be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		\forall b \in \mathbf{B}, a \text{ is unique if } \exists
		a \in \mathbf{A} \text{ such that } f(a) = b \\
		\forall c \in \mathbf{C}, b \text{ is unique if } \exists
		b \in \mathbf{B} \text{ such that } g(b) = c
	\end{align*}
	This means that we now have:
	\begin{equation*}
		\forall c \in \mathbf{C}, a \text{ is unique if } \exists
		a \in \mathbf{A} \text{ such that } g(f(a)) = c \qedhere
	\end{equation*}
\end{proof}
\end{document}
