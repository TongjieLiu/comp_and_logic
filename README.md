# *Computability and Logic*
Some solutions of mine to problems in the *Computability and Logic*, 5th edition.




# Rendering to PDF Format
The solutions are written in latex, and you could render them into PDF format.

To do that, first you have to install a Tex distribution such as TeX Live. On
Debian or Ubuntu you may run command `sudo apt-get install texlive`. And then,
you could do the rendering by running command `pdflatex solution.tex`.

Some solutions need a latex package called IEEEtrantools, you have to install
it by running command `sudo apt-get install texlive-publishers`.
