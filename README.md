Some solutions of mine to problems in the *Computability and Logic*,
*5th Edition*.




# Rendering into PDF Format
The solutions are written in LaTeX, and you could render them into PDF format.

To do that, first you have to install a TeX distribution such as TeX Live. On
Debian or Ubuntu you may run command `sudo apt-get install texlive`. And then,
you could do the rendering by running command `pdflatex solution.tex`.

Some solutions need a LaTeX package called IEEEtrantools, for this reason you
have to install it before rendering them into PDF format by running command
`sudo apt-get install texlive-publishers`.
