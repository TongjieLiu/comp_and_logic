# *Computability and Logic*
Some solutions of mine to problems in the *Computability and Logic*, 5th edition.




# Rendering to PDF Format
The solutions are written in latex, and you could render them into PDF format.

To do that, first you have to install a Tex distribution such as TeX Live. On
Debian or Ubuntu you may run `sudo apt-get install texlive`. And then, you could
do the rendering by running `pdflatex solution.tex`.
